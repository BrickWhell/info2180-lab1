     I am a 23 year old student of the University of the West Indies. My interests include playing music, photography and videography.
     I am interested in web development as it allows people to connect with just about anyone in the world. As the use and stability of the internet as a part of life becomes more present 
     the web becomes not just a part of life but a tool for making life better. I would like to build ways to deliver more information through the web in more effective ways.
